## Risk Evaluation Persona Output

### Who Evaluated the Risk?
**Persona**: Change Risk Assessor (typically from Risk Management, IT Risk, or Change Management Office)

**Role Responsibilities**:
- Evaluate technical risk of proposed changes
- Assess business impact and continuity risks
- Determine change classification (Standard/Normal/Major/Emergency)
- Identify mitigation requirements
- Recommend approval or rejection

### Risk Assessment Results for v2.1 Deployment

Based on the Risk Evaluator Persona's assessment:

| Risk Category | Assessment | Justification |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| **Overall Risk Level** | **LOW-MEDIUM** | Enhancement to existing system, backward compatible, well-documented |
| **Technical Risk** | LOW | No infrastructure changes, system prompt update only |
| **Business Risk** | LOW | Enhanced capabilities, no functionality removed |
| **Security Risk** | LOW | Enhanced security (data classification, MNPI protection) |
| **Compliance Risk** | LOW | Improves compliance posture (SR 11-7, FHFA awareness) |
| **Operational Risk** | MEDIUM | Requires user training and RAG configuration |
| **Data Risk** | MEDIUM | Requires data classification before full deployment |

**Change Classification**: **NORMAL CHANGE**
- Not a Standard Change (too significant for pre-approved template)
- Not an Emergency Change (no crisis situation)
- Not a Major Change (no high business impact or extensive modifications)

**Recommendation**: **APPROVE with conditions** (data classification, user training, phased rollout)

## SECTION 2: CHANGE DESCRIPTION

### Description of Change
```
WHAT TO WRITE:

Deployment of AI Gov Chatbot version 2.1 Financial Sector Edition, 
replacing the current v2.0 system instructions. This is an enhancement 
update that adds financial services capabilities while maintaining 
all existing AI governance functionality.

Version 2.1 adds:
1. Financial data investigation framework (goal extraction, metric 
   tracking, data source tracing)
2. Financial performance reporting (strategic goal reports, KPI 
   dashboards, data source investigations)
3. Enhanced regulatory compliance (SR 11-7, FHFA, CFPB, SOX awareness)
4. 100 additional domain experts (50 financial analysts, 30 compliance 
   officers, 20 risk managers)
5. Financial data protection controls (data classification enforcement, 
   MNPI safeguards)

The change involves updating the system prompt instructions in the 
AI platform. No infrastructure, database, or application code changes 
are required.
```

### Business Justification
```
WHAT TO WRITE:

Current v2.0 system lacks financial domain expertise and systematic 
data investigation capabilities required for GSE operations. Manual 
financial analysis tasks currently consume 40-60 hours per week across 
Risk Management, Strategy, and Compliance teams.

v2.1 Financial Edition addresses this gap by:
- Automating 90%+ of routine financial analysis tasks (goal extraction, 
  data investigation, report generation)
- Ensuring regulatory compliance with SR 11-7 model risk management 
  and FHFA oversight requirements
- Providing systematic data quality assessment across 5 dimensions
- Enabling rapid financial performance reporting with health scores

Expected ROI: $100K-$270K annual savings in analyst time, with immediate 
payback period (~16 hours implementation vs. 1,000-1,800 hours saved 
annually).

Business Impact: Accelerates strategic decision-making, improves data 
quality visibility, ensures regulatory compliance, reduces manual effort 
by 90%+.
```

### What Happens If Change Is Not Implemented?
```
WHAT TO WRITE:

Without this change:
1. Financial analysis remains manual and time-intensive (40-60 hrs/week)
2. No systematic data quality assessment capability
3. Limited visibility into strategic goal progress across documents
4. SR 11-7 model risk management assessments remain manual and inconsistent
5. Data lineage and source tracing continues as ad-hoc effort
6. Miss opportunity for $100K-$270K annual cost savings

Risk Level of Not Implementing: MEDIUM
- Operational inefficiency continues
- Potential compliance gaps in model risk management
- Competitive disadvantage in financial analysis speed

## TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL FORM COMPLETION

### General Best Practices

1. **Be Specific and Detailed**
   - Use exact version numbers (v2.0 → v2.1)
   - Quantify impact (90% time savings, $100K savings)
   - Include concrete examples

2. **Use Data from Risk Assessment**
   - Reference the Risk Evaluator Persona's findings
   - Include their risk ratings and justifications
   - Show mitigation for identified risks

3. **Demonstrate Backward Compatibility**
   - Emphasize 100% backward compatibility
   - Highlight that no functionality is removed
   - Show simple rollback plan

4. **Quantify Business Value**
   - Time savings (hours per week)
   - Cost savings (annual $ amount)
   - ROI and payback period
   - Compliance improvement

5. **Show Comprehensive Testing**
   - List all test phases
   - Include UAT sign-off
   - Document test results

6. **Have Clear Success Criteria**
   - Technical metrics (response time, error rate)
   - Business metrics (usage, satisfaction)
   - Compliance metrics (audit findings, controls)

7. **Address Common CAB Questions Proactively**
   - "What if this fails?" → Rollback plan
   - "How do we know it's safe?" → Security testing
   - "Will users need help?" → Training plan
   - "What's the business value?" → ROI analysis

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Vague descriptions** ("Updating AI system")  
✅ **Specific details** ("Deploying v2.1 with financial data investigation capabilities")

❌ **No rollback plan** or complicated rollback  
✅ **Simple, tested rollback** (15-30 minutes to revert)

❌ **Missing dependencies** (discovering during deployment)  
✅ **All dependencies identified and status tracked**

❌ **Insufficient testing** (skip UAT, no security testing)  
✅ **Comprehensive test strategy** (unit, integration, UAT, security, performance)

❌ **No user communication** (surprise deployment)  
✅ **Communication plan** (pre/during/post deployment notifications)

❌ **Unclear success criteria** ("Users will like it")  
✅ **Measurable criteria** (80% user satisfaction, <1% error rate)

❌ **Generic risk assessment** (copy-paste from templates)  
✅ **Specific risk analysis** (v2.1-specific risks with tailored mitigations)

## APPROVAL STRATEGY

### Getting Through CAB (Change Advisory Board)

#### What CAB Cares About

1. **Business Value** - Why are we doing this?
   - **Your Answer**: 90% time savings, $100K-$270K annual savings, improved compliance

2. **Risk** - What could go wrong?
   - **Your Answer**: LOW-MEDIUM risk, backward compatible, simple rollback, comprehensive testing

3. **Testing** - How do we know it works?
   - **Your Answer**: UAT complete with sign-off, security tested, performance validated

4. **User Impact** - Will users be disrupted?
   - **Your Answer**: Enhanced capabilities, no disruption, training provided

5. **Rollback** - Can we undo this quickly?
   - **Your Answer**: Yes, 15-30 minute rollback to v2.0

#### Anticipate These Questions

**Q: "Why not wait for v3.0 or a more mature version?"**  
**A**: v2.1 is production-ready (tested, documented, backward compatible). Waiting costs $100K+ in continued manual effort. Risk is LOW-MEDIUM with comprehensive mitigations.

**Q: "What if the AI gives wrong answers with financial data?"**  
**A**: Data quality scoring alerts users to reliability issues. All outputs are cited to source documents for verification. Human judgment still required for final decisions (90/10 rule).

**Q: "How do we know this won't expose confidential financial data?"**  
**A**: Data classification enforcement built-in. MNPI protection tested. Access controls validated. Security testing passed in UAT.

**Q: "What's the user training burden?"**  
**A**: 4-8 hours per power user. Training materials prepared. Optional for casual users (backward compatible means existing queries still work).

**Q: "What happens during the deployment window?"**

---

## The "4 New Powers" Framework

Think of v2.1 as v2.0 with **4 superpowers** for financial services:

### 🎯 Power 1: Goal Extraction
**What it does**: Automatically finds and tracks strategic goals across all documents  
**Example query**: *"Find all strategic goals related to affordable housing"*  
**Output**: Structured table with goal, owner, target date, status, linked metrics, data sources  
**Time saved**: 4-8 hours → 15 minutes (95% reduction)

### 🔍 Power 2: Data Investigation
**What it does**: Traces metrics to source systems, assesses quality, maps lineage  
**Example query**: *"Investigate data sources for serious delinquency rate"*  
**Output**: Data lineage diagram, quality scores, source catalog, gaps identified  
**Time saved**: 2-4 hours → 10 minutes (95% reduction)

### 📊 Power 3: Financial Reporting
**What it does**: Generates comprehensive reports with dashboards, trends, health scores  
**Example query**: *"Create Q3 performance report for credit risk portfolio"*  
**Output**: Executive summary, KPI dashboard, trend analysis, action items  
**Time saved**: 8-16 hours → 30 minutes (97% reduction)

### ✅ Power 4: Regulatory Compliance
**What it does**: Native understanding of SR 11-7, FHFA, CFPB, SOX, Dodd-Frank  
**Example query**: *"Assess our credit model for SR 11-7 compliance"*  
**Output**: Model risk management assessment with gaps and recommendations  
**Enhancement**: Adds financial regulatory context to all AI governance assessments

---

## The "Everything Still Works" Guarantee

### ✅ All Original v2.0 Capabilities Intact
1. **AI Governance Assessment** (NIST AI RMF, OWASP, ISO 42001, EU AI Act)
2. **Milestone Health Reporting** (now with financial impact tracking)
3. **Knowledge Recall & Synthesis** (now with data quality scoring)
4. **Risk & Dependency Analysis** (now with 9 financial risk categories)

### ✅ All Security Protections Active
- Prompt injection defense
- System prompt protection
- Jailbreak resistance
- RAG poisoning prevention
- **PLUS**: Financial data classification enforcement, MNPI protection

### ✅ 100% Backward Compatible
- Every v2.0 query still works in v2.1
- No breaking changes
- Enhanced, not replaced

---

## The "When to Use What" Decision Tree

```
Need AI governance assessment?
├─ Non-financial system → v2.0 or v2.1 (both work)
└─ Financial system → v2.1 (adds SR 11-7, FHFA context)

Need to track program milestones?
├─ Without financial metrics → v2.0 works
└─ With budget/ROI tracking → v2.1 (enhanced)

Need to extract goals from documents?
├─ Manual extraction acceptable → v2.0 might work
└─ Systematic extraction needed → v2.1 ONLY

Need to investigate data sources?
├─ Don't need lineage/quality → v2.0 might work
└─ Need traceability/quality scores → v2.1 ONLY

Need financial performance reports?
├─ Basic document Q&A → v2.0 works
└─ Comprehensive dashboards → v2.1 ONLY

Subject to GSE regulations?
├─ No → v2.0 sufficient
└─ Yes (FHFA, SR 11-7) → v2.1 REQUIRED
```

**Simple Rule**: If you're in financial services and need systematic data analysis → Use v2.1

---

## The "3 Phases" Investigation Framework

When v2.1 investigates financial data, it follows this pattern:

### Phase 1: DISCOVER
- Searches RAG knowledge base for relevant documents
- Uses financial-specific search patterns
- Filters by document type (strategic, operational, technical, governance)

### Phase 2: EXTRACT & VALIDATE
- Pulls structured data using templates
- Scores data quality across 5 dimensions
- Validates consistency across sources

### Phase 3: SYNTHESIZE & REPORT
- Links goals → metrics → data sources
- Identifies patterns and gaps
- Generates comprehensive findings with citations

**Mental Model**: Think of it as a financial analyst who never gets tired, works 24/7, and has perfect memory of all documents.

---

## The "5 Quality Dimensions" Scoring

v2.1 assesses data quality using this formula:

```
Data Quality Score = 
  (Completeness × 0.25) +    // Are all required fields populated?
  (Consistency × 0.25) +     // Do metrics match across documents?
  (Timeliness × 0.20) +      // How current is the data?
  (Accuracy × 0.20) +        // Can we verify against source?
  (Lineage × 0.10)           // Is data provenance clear?

Color Coding:
■ Green: 80-100 (High quality, reliable for decisions)
■ Amber: 60-79 (Usable with caveats)
■ Red: <60 (Significant issues, not suitable for critical decisions)
```

**Quick Check**: If data quality is Green (80+), trust it. If Red (<60), investigate before deciding.

---

## The "9 Financial Risk Categories" Map

v2.1 understands these financial risk types (v2.0 had only 4 general risks):

1. **Credit Risk** → Borrower default, loan losses
2. **Market Risk** → Interest rates, spreads, securities pricing
3. **Operational Risk** → Process failures, system outages, fraud
4. **Liquidity Risk** → Ability to meet obligations
5. **Model Risk** → Flawed models, incorrect outputs (SR 11-7)
6. **Strategic Risk** → Poor decisions, market changes
7. **Compliance Risk** → Regulatory penalties, enforcement
8. **Reputational Risk** → Brand damage, stakeholder trust
9. **AI/Technology Risk** → AI-specific vulnerabilities

**Mental Model**: v2.1 thinks like a financial risk manager, not just a tech specialist.

---

## The "Data Classification" Security Layer

v2.1 enforces these data sensitivity levels:

| Level | Description | v2.1 Handling |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **PUBLIC** | Publicly available information | Can discuss freely |
| **INTERNAL** | Internal use only | Can discuss in appropriate context |
| **CONFIDENTIAL** | Restricted to authorized personnel | Restricted discussion, verify need-to-know |
| **RESTRICTED** | Highly sensitive (MNPI, PII) | Cannot discuss; refer to appropriate channels |

**Mental Model**: v2.1 acts like a compliance officer - it won't leak sensitive information even if asked.

---

## The "Freddie Mac Vocabulary" Primer

v2.1 natively understands these GSE/mortgage finance terms:

- **GSE**: Government-Sponsored Enterprise (Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae)
- **UPB**: Unpaid Principal Balance (total amount owed on loans)
- **SDQ**: Serious Delinquency Rate (loans 90+ days past due)
- **CRT**: Credit Risk Transfer (shifting risk to private investors)
- **STACR**: Structured Agency Credit Risk (CRT securities)
- **ACIS**: Agency Credit Insurance Structure (insurance-based CRT)
- **DTI**: Debt-to-Income ratio (borrower qualification metric)
- **LTV**: Loan-to-Value ratio (loan amount vs property value)
- **AHP**: Affordable Housing Program
- **Duty to Serve**: Affordable housing mandates

**Customization Note**: Section 10 of v2.1 instructions can be customized with your organization's specific vocabulary.

---

## The "6 Regulatory Frameworks" Context

v2.1 provides native compliance context for:

| Framework | What It Governs | v2.1 Application |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **NIST AI RMF** | AI trustworthiness | Core AI governance |
| **OWASP LLM** | LLM security | AI system vulnerabilities |
| **ISO 42001** | AI management | AI management system |
| **EU AI Act** | AI risk classification | Risk-based approach |
| **SR 11-7** (NEW) | Model risk management | Financial model validation |
| **FHFA Guidelines** (NEW) | GSE oversight | GSE-specific governance |

**Mental Model**: v2.1 is fluent in both AI governance AND financial services regulation.

---

## The "Report Type Selector" Guide

Choose the right report type for your need:

### Use **Strategic Goal Progress Report** when:
- ✅ Tracking business objectives and OKRs
- ✅ Quarterly business reviews
- ✅ Board reporting
- ✅ Strategic planning cycles

### Use **Financial Metrics Dashboard** when:
- ✅ Monitoring KPIs
- ✅ Performance analysis
- ✅ Trend tracking
- ✅ Executive dashboards

- ✅ Source system documentation

### Use **Milestone Health Report** when:
- ✅ Program/project tracking
- ✅ Critical path analysis
- ✅ Dependency management
- ✅ Risk escalation

---

## The "Expert Weighting" Context Map

v2.1 dynamically adjusts expert perspectives based on query type:

| Query Type | Primary Experts | Weighting Focus |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Safety-Critical AI** | Aerospace (30%) → Law Enforcement (20%) → Financial (15%) | Systems thinking, failure analysis |
| **Security Assessment** | Red Team (35%) → Compliance (15%) → Developers (20%) | Vulnerability testing, controls |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Compliance (40%) → Law Enforcement (25%) → Risk (15%) | Audit, regulations, evidence |
| **Financial Analysis** | Financial Analysts (45%) → Risk Managers (25%) | Business metrics, market dynamics |
| **Model Risk** | Risk Managers (35%) → Financial Analysts (25%) | Model validation, SR 11-7 |
| **Data Quality** | Developers (35%) → Financial Analysts (25%) → Risk (20%) | Data engineering, quality assessment |

**Mental Model**: v2.1 assembles the right "expert panel" for each question automatically.

---

## The "Implementation Effort" Reality Check

### Deployment Breakdown

| Phase | Activities | Time Required | Complexity |
|-------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Week 1: Deploy** | Copy instructions, connect RAG, classify data, configure access | 8-16 hours | ⭐⭐ Medium |
| **Week 2: Test** | Sample queries, validate outputs, refine | 8-12 hours | ⭐⭐ Medium |
| **Week 3: Train** | User training, documentation, support setup | 4-8 hours | ⭐ Low |
| **Week 4: Launch** | Production rollout, monitoring, feedback | Ongoing | ⭐ Low |

**Total**: 20-36 hours over 4 weeks  
**ROI**: Immediate (saves 90%+ on routine tasks from day 1)

## The "Critical Success Factors" Checklist

For successful v2.1 deployment, ensure:

- [ ] **RAG knowledge base** populated with financial documents (strategy, reports, metrics, data docs)
- [ ] **Data classification** labels applied (PUBLIC/INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED)
- [ ] **Access controls** configured based on user roles and document sensitivity
- [ ] **Logging enabled** for security monitoring and audit trails
- [ ] **Section 10 customized** with your organization's specific vocabulary and data sources
- [ ] **Users trained** on new query types and capabilities
- [ ] **Support process** established for questions and issues
- [ ] **Success metrics** defined (usage, time savings, quality improvements)

**Minimum Viable Deployment**: At minimum, need RAG connection and data classification to unlock full value.

---

## The "Common Mistakes" Prevention Guide

### ❌ Don't Do This
1. Deploy without data classification → Can't enforce security properly
2. Skip user training → Low adoption, capabilities underutilized
3. Use generic queries → Won't trigger financial-specific features
4. Ignore data quality scores → Make decisions on unreliable data
5. Forget to customize Section 10 → Miss organization-specific context

### ✅ Do This Instead
1. Apply data classification to all documents before launch
2. Run training sessions with live examples
3. Use specific, financial-focused queries (see cheat sheet above)
4. Check data quality scores before trusting outputs
5. Spend 30-60 minutes customizing vocabulary in Section 10

---

## The "Version Control" Mental Model

Think of versions this way:

### v2.0 (Original)
**Archetype**: General-purpose AI governance specialist  
**Best for**: Non-financial tech projects, simple governance needs  
**Limitation**: No financial domain expertise

### v2.1 (Financial Sector)
**Archetype**: AI governance specialist WITH financial analyst skills  
**Best for**: Financial services, GSEs, regulated institutions  
**Enhancement**: All of v2.0 PLUS financial data investigation, reporting, compliance

### Future Versions
- v2.2 could add: Real-time market data, predictive analytics, automated stress testing
- v2.3 could add: Multi-entity consolidation, cross-border regulatory compliance
- **Current focus**: Master v2.1 first, gather feedback, identify next enhancements

---

## The "90% Rule" ROI Principle

**Core Insight**: v2.1 automates 90%+ of routine financial analysis work, but the remaining 10% requires human judgment.
